# The Story of My Life

**Hi, my name is Kenny and I am a Junior studying Computer Science at UCSD.**
*Despite my ambition for Computers, I am often not fond of technology and will avoid it during leisure.*
*Technology empowers our future but can also devastate us, so I often refrain from being reliant on technology.*
*During my free time, I like to surf, hike, and cook! Here are some pictures*
